      As a software engineer, I have developed a strong foundation in HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, and TypeScript, which are the building blocks of web
      development. I have honed my skills in React JS, a popular and powerful
      JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I am proficient in Git,
      which is essential for version control and collaboration in team
      environments.
      <br />
      <br />
      In addition to these core skills, I am also exploring SCSS, Bootstrap,
      ChakraUI, and Tailwind. These tools enhance my ability to create stylish,
      responsive, and user-friendly designs. On the backend, I am learning
      NodeJS, expanding my capabilities to full-stack development. My passion
      for learning drives me to continuously explore new technologies and
      methodologies in the ever-evolving field of software engineering.
